# Module 3. JS Core. Lesson 8. Task 1 (v.3).

# String `.split()`. Method. Counting the number of Spaces in the input text.

This code is designed to take text input from the user, count the number of spaces in that text using the `.split()` String method, which splits the text into an array of strings using a space as the delimiter, the `.length` property, and outputs the result to the console.

- Added use of JavaScript Regular expression literals (line 4).
